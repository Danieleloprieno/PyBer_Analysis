# Analysis of PyBer Fares by City Type

## Overview
This ad hoc analysis of driver fares by city type was conducted at the request of V. Isualize.  The purpose of this analysis is to explore how PyBer can leverage this information to inform future business decisions.

## Results
Summary data was organized into a Python DataFrame and line chart to illustrate trends in fares by city types.  The sumamry DataFrame shows that the majority of PyBer riders and drivers live in Urban areas.  The biggest takeaway for PyBer is that profit drivers for the company are in Urban areas.  Urban riders and drivers are accountable for almost the same dollar amount of fares as Rural and Suburban areas combined.  That said - Urban areas also have the lowest average fare and the lowest average fare per driver, making it less ideal for drivers themselves.  This is likely due to the fact that city rides are shorter (and therefore, cost less to riders) and the fact that drivers outnumber average rides almost 2:1.  By contrast, rural areas are the only city type where the total number of rides exceeds the total number of drivers - resulting in the whopping $55.49 average fare per driver in rural areas.  Suburban areas seem to be the best city type for drivers in terms of market competition and fare prices - there are slightly more rides than drivers, and the average fare per driver is close to $40 - well over twice what you'd make in the city for being twice as busy.

The chart below illustrates these trends week over week during the first half of 2019.  This chart illustrates the consistently high fares in Urban areas, followed by Subruban and Rural.  All city types have a bump between February and March, most likely due to Valentines Day.

## Summary

As stated previously - the biggest profit making areas for PyBer are Urban areas, but it has the lowest average fare per ride.  Consider initatives to incetivies drivers to complete more rides per driving period to increase profits in an already profitable area.

Areas with a smaller number of drivers have higher average fares per ride and average fares per driver, but they are not as profitable as urban areas.  Perhaps increased advertising in these areas will help genrate interest in using PyBer - espeically in Suburban areas, where there is a good supply of current drivers with a slightly larger amount of total rides.  

Rural areas seem to be suffering the most from a lack of drivers, which may be impacting potential revenue in this area.  One way to possibly increase revenue in these areas would be to increase the availability of drivers - perhaps messaging around the higher average fares per ride/driver to potential drivers would be beneficial in generating interest in driving for PyBer.
